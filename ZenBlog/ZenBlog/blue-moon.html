              <h1 class="mb-5">Hey, it Must be a Blue Moon</h1>
              <p><span class="firstcharacter">S</span>o today I took out my cap, put it on then my hoodie on top of the cap (Incognito Mode), put on my least favourite shoes, bent on one knee, tied up my laces and went off running through the vast fields of Olekasasi, deep through the Northside of cool and currently wet Kajiado county, my normal routine. But today felt different though, it wasn't like the other days I usually do this without any effort. For some reason, my feet felt heavier and my body lighter for the entire run. I had a sharp and subtle pain in my right leg which I had gotten during a basketball game but it didn't bother me, I have endured way worse. </p>

              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="assets/img/post-landscape-1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">

              </figure>
              <p>The first five minutes of my jogs are usually the most exhilarating. I am usually psyched up, excited and full of energy. I pat Stanley, step out of the gate and start my run. I mean I was full of energy and the psych was not that down either but I still felt like something was missing today. It didn't stop me from going all Kipchoge though despite the evening being a little darker (I think we're in the 'longer nights and shorter days' season, or vice versa, I am not sure (My Geog teacher should not see this, Haha). Despite starting strong and all psyched up, I always have to start at a slow pace and then ease into a more comfortable, slightly faster pace that will last me for the whole run. Don't get me wrong, everyone would want to start fast but you're going to end up running out of gas in 30 seconds (If you know what am Saying, Haha). The best moment in my runs is when I hit my <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-truth-behind-runners-high-and-other-mental-benefits-of-running#:~:text=As%20you%20hit%20your%20stride,euphoric%20state%20following%20intense%20exercise.">Runners High</a> and then do the <a href="https://www.mpl.live/blog/siuuu-meaning-cristiano-ronaldo/#:~:text=stuck%20ever%20since.-,What%20does%20Siuuu%20mean%3F,'%20in%20Spanish.">Siiuuuuuuu</a>. I am usually at my sort of top speed, and all I want at this point is to just keep running (it's like an orgasm but for runs, Haha), my whole body feels comfortable and I just randomly think about the best things life has to offer, like her smile when she sees me, or my dream car and Mansion, or all my ideas coming to life, just random life stuff while the wind blows past my ears.</p>
              <p>But today was different in that my feet felt a bit off, like they were not comfortable in my shoes and I couldn't hit my runner's High. Even Mama Mboga could notice that I was running differently, so I decided to have a slow walk for the rest of the trip to get my veggies for Kienyeji Saturday (Yeah, I know what you're thinking, my world is awesome, Haha). The after-run meditation thoughts are my second favourite thing about this routine. This is the point where I find solutions to almost every issue in this country (theoretically and hypothetically, Haha). I mean I can draft a whole plan to re-strengthen the country's economy, shoot the Ksh. up or even win the girl of my dreams, I mean at this point, all I have to do is to focus on something and I will feel like I have the perfect-working plan to solve it or to get it. It's not delirium, it is more of clarity. A silent walk back home also gives me room for introspection and reflection. I'm usually lost in my thoughts at this point until a Tuktuk swerves close to me and I snap back into reality. I mean, at this moment I am just usually accepting things for the way they are, especially those I can't control, I think of the few times I have been an awful person or a bad friend and the number of times people have let me down and I just let it all of it go. At this point my anxiety is usually at zero and I can retrospectively think of anything calmly with the objective of letting go and growing into a better me.</p>
              <p>So walking back home from Mama Mboga, there was a full moon, blazing behind Africa Nazarene University. I love nights by the way, they are peaceful, the wifi speed never buffers and the Traffic along Mombasa Road looks Magical when viewed from a rooftop in Rongai. I mean if we took out crime and creeps, nights would be the whole package, simple, peaceful and awesome. The moon was huge-yellow-round and full, or was it half? I walked closer to the edge of the road, stopped, stood on a rock and stared at it for a little longer, The closer I got to the edge of the road the larger it grew and the more it looked like it wasn't full. Am I trippin or something? I mean it would somehow appear to be crescent, but with a faded side making it look full. From a different angle, it would look Gibbous, but with a crescent, more-saturated side inside and a faded side making it look whole (I know you're probably lost, Haha). Okay maybe I am losing my sight a bit, I have been staring at screens for really long periods due to the nature of my job, or maybe I was just confused today. Despite all that, the moment really felt peaceful, it was an awesome vibe. My armpits were sweaty from the workout and the breeze made my body feel relieved, but also raise awareness of the stink in my workout shoes (Yeah I gotta wash them). I mean maybe the one thing that could have made this night better was me holding her hand and sharing the feeling, and we'd stare at the moon for a while before going home and rocking Kienyeji Saturday. (Yes that's a thing in my World Haha). </p>
              <p>Maybe she is the piece I was missing for this vibe to be awesomely perfect. I mean, the road was full of murram and settled dust and it was just me walking home (I mean I know it's a Saturday but where's everyone?) and fewer Tuktuks were flowing by now and believe you me I could hear the crickets argue. But again with more introspection, she wasn't the piece I missing to complement this vibe, because I found all the peace I needed in this silence and I don't think anyone could match it. So what was I missing really? This reminded me of a scene in the series 'How I Met Your Mother', the main character, Ted meets this girl Victoria at a wedding party, they are so into each other and everything is so perfect that they decide not to ruin it by getting to know each other, they agree that they're just gonna dance and talk and then leave and never try to find each other. The point is that when they're old somewhere else and they reminisce of that day, it would be perfect because it never got ruined by stuff like getting to know more about each other's baggage, bad habits or even breaking up. That would be the one perfect night in both their memories for the rest of their lives. They would recall this night when they were old and it would be perfect. But that is not life, Ted immediately goes trying to find her the next because hey, I mean the night would still end with an imperfect awful goodbye scene. Life has no perfections, at least not mine I'm just saying. We can only get close to perfection, and that is usually a pile of imperfections that build up, do you get what I'm saying?</p>
              <p>First, I was sort of disappointed that I didn't have a smartphone to capture the moon and share it with the article then secondly, no one else seemed to match my vibe. The few people outside (probably night runners, Haha) were just walking by like it was a regular night. I guess this kinda vibe is just for the few. In a way, this Moon was me, it's the Blue moon (Yeah you saw this coming, haha). I mean it's perfect, look at it, Damn. From a different angle, it is saturated, and it has awesome vibes, like a crescent piece, shaped like a banana. It's small but it still brightens up all the neighbourhoods. From another angle, it is full, overwhelmed with life, with the expectations it has, with the disappointments that come with it, has everything set but at the same time nothing to show for it. From another angle, it is like a Gibbous, it's almost perfectly complete, but also feels like it's missing a piece to make it whole and you don't know what that piece is. All in all, it's just clarity I was seeking on this moon, Like Hey, just be clear about what you are. This Blue moon made me realise something tonight, I was trying to have a fixated mind that it should look like something, but I was simply ignoring its reality, I mean bro, it's not gibbous, Look at it, it is a crescent, Noo it's a Full moon, don't you have eyes man? Hell Noo, it is a Crescent. Noo, it's a gibboucrescentfulllbaltony….</p>

Anyways, My Managu and Terere is ready and all I can say is my Kienyeji game is strong (Please don't turn this into a dirty joke). Shoutout to Mama Mboga. How did I use 5 plates and all my Sufurias to make such a simple meal though? And who's gonna wash these Damn dishes???</p>
